## My process
Making the card itself was easier as i had already made one for the previous project.
Using the hover element i was able to change the color of different elements when the cursor is hovering over them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to use hover on different elements and how to change the color on said elements when hover is being used.

### Continued development

I would like to tackle more complex layouts and understand how to implement box shadows next.
